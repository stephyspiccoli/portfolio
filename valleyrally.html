    <p class="gutter-1-2 push-2 pad-b-2" style="
    margin-bottom: 0px">Valley Rally is looking to develop a brand
and a website. The adventure tours will
be marketed to an international audience,
but specifically with Canadians
in mind. The goal is to represent Valley
Rally as a leader in adventure sports, not
just in Canada, but worldwide.<br></br>
The objective was to create an easy to
use website that conveys the free spirit
of Valley Rally in its imagery of riders and
environments. All key information will
be presented in a clear method that is
consistent with the developed brand.
The brand will focus on the adventurous
aspect of the experience.
